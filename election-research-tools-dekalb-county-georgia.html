An excellent source for making a list of offices you might be voting for, this official voting and elections site of DeKalb County is fairly current, although it usually does not post the <strong>sample ballot</strong> (PDF) very far in advance of elections due to close candidate registration deadlines. It requires additional web browser plug-ins, but you can also download forms to <strong>register to vote</strong> absentee, or to become a voter before registration deadlines. It also posts <strong>candidate filings</strong> for <a href="http://web.dekalbcountyga.gov/Voter/reports.asp" title="Campaign Disclosure reports">campaign contributions</a> and for <a href="http://web.dekalbcountyga.gov/Voter/fReports.asp" title="Financial Disclosures">financial disclosures</a>.

This online book can be useful in evaluating whether the policies of incumbents have positively impacted statistics you care about, such as: crime, health, home ownership, minority-owned businesses, poverty, etc. Unfortunately its statistics often end about two years prior to today&#39;s date and small towns are not considered cities, but it can still be a helpful long-term gauge of the trends in your area. <strong>Update</strong>: The <a href="https://www.census.gov/compendia/databooks/" title="Link to discontinuation notice">U.S. Census Bureau discontinued this book</a>, BUT still has links to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/10smadb/appendixd.pdf" title="State sources for statistical data about crimes, labor, etc.">state</a> and <a href="https://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/10smadb/contacts.pdf" title="Federal sources for statistical data about crimes, labor, etc.">national</a> sources to get some of this same data, including: <a href="https://georgiadata.org/about.html">Georgia Data (free)</a>.</li>

(2007). <a href="http://www.dekalblibrary.org/go.php?isbn=9780820329062" title="Politics in Georgia book"><em>Politics in Georgia</em></a>. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press.</strong> If one can get past the dry, scholarly style of writing and lack of visually-helpful diagrams, this is a very useful book for understanding contemporary politics in Georgia. Of particular interest were the facts about how primary, general, special, and run-off elections work and which interest groups are active and effective at both the state and local levels. A similar and slightly more updated book the <a href="http://www.dekalblibrary.org/go.php?isbn=9780205706853">2010</a> or <a href="https://www.pearsonhighered.com/product/Bullock-Georgia-Politics-in-a-State-of-Change-2nd-Edition/9780205864676.html">2013</a> edition of Charles&#39; Bullock&#39;s <strong>Georgia politics in a state of change</strong>.</p>

Carl Vinson Institute of Government: University of Georgia. </strong>This book is a better starting point than the Fleischmann book, despite its publication date in 1991, as it takes a more basic instructional and less academic tone, includes many helpful diagrams and visuals, and is brief and to the point.&nbsp; This book functions as a basic civics textbook for Georgia voters, one that could lead to a greater understanding of state government on election day.</p>

Judicial Selection and the Qualities That Make a &quot;Good&quot; Judge. <em>Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 462</em>, 112-124. Retrieved October 13, 2008, from JSTOR database.</strong>This article is great for helping voters choose criteria to use when deciding between judicial candidates. Goldman recommends the following <em>major criteria for judicial candidates</em>: neutrality as to the parties in litigation; fair-mindedness; well versed in the law; ability to think, write, and speak logically and lucidly; personal integrity; good physical and mental health; judicial temperament; and ability to handle judicial power sensibly. Other criteria that he mentions as potentially important are: administrative and managerial skills; public relations skills with the legal profession, the media, and the general public; political skills with public officials and legislatures; and whether the candidate adds to the diversity of the judiciary.&nbsp; This article goes into some detail about how to identify these qualities in particular candidates. He concludes that, although most of these desired judicial qualities are very subjective, it is important to continue searching for objective ways by which to gauge them.</p>
