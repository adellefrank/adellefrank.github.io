    <div class="content clearfix">

      <p>How can web developers make it easier for voters to keep government honest and make informed decisions in the voting booth? To begin to answer this question, I've done a preliminary survey of research on voter information behavior, especially as it relates to online usage.</p><p>
</p>
<p>I've distilled the relevant bits from 3 articles that give overviews of current research, as well as the practical design recommendations from 1 fabulous NSF-funded research report. I also list over 70 useful government guidelines compiled for state voter web sites.</p>
<ul id="toc" role="navigation">
    <li><a href="#1">Article 1</a>: Copeland &amp; Garn survey 6 major theories of voter behavior in local school board elections</li>
    <li><a href="#2">Article 2</a>: Druckman examines 2 major theories &amp; offers 2 recommendations for future research</li>
    <li><a href="#3">Article 3</a>: Robertson, Wania, &amp; Park list 4 strategies for decision-making and a number of observed voter preferences and behaviors</li>
    <li><a href="#4">Article 4</a>: U.S. Election Assistance Commission lists 6 types of voters, 5 common voter concerns, and over 70 guidelines for state voter information websites</li>
    <li><a href="#biblio">Bibliography</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="1">Article 1</a></h3>
<p><em>by Copeland &amp; Garn</em></p>
<p><strong>6 Theories mentioned:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>partisanship</li>
    <li>friends and neighbors</li>
    <li>retrospective voting</li>
    <li>dissatisfaction voting</li>
    <li>issue voting</li>
    <li>capture</li>
</ul>
<p>Copeland &amp; Garn (2007) note that the local arena has not been explored much by voting behavior theorists and that the most frequent local election is for school board members.&nbsp; They use this election type to explore the veracity of voting behavior theories when tested at the often-ignored local level. In addition to some interesting insights into information sources for local elections, they review a number of theories of voting behavior in the process. They find that the <span class="pullquote"><em>'friends and neighbors' voting was the most compelling</em></span> for their focus group participants and that character judgments were particularly valued.</p>
<p>First, they explore theories of <strong>partisanship</strong>. Because these races are largely non-partisan, there is frequently little information and even less interest. In low information elections, voters often rely for guidance on shortcut cues such as: incumbency, name recognition, and party.</p>
<p>Second, Copeland &amp; Garn cover V. O. Key's <em><strong>friends and neighbors</strong></em> theory, in which citizens "vote for people they know, people who live or work around them, or &nbsp;candidates known to friends or associates." They then cover <strong>retrospective</strong> voting - in which voters judge the incumbents based on past performance - and the <strong>dissatisfaction</strong> theory - in which  voters turn out in higher numbers to cast votes against the status quo when  they are unhappy.</p>
<p>The next theory, <strong>issue</strong> voting, explores whether voters use candidates' positions and character when making voting decisions. This is broader than the <strong>capture</strong> theory, in which highly motivated individuals or groups are more likely to vote - or are perceived to be so by the candidates - because they have a direct, special interest in the outcome.</p>
<h3><a name="2">Article 2</a></h3>
<p><em>by Druckman</em></p>
<p><strong>Main theories:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>information shortcuts</li>
    <li>overall evaluation (not individual facts) are remembered</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendations for future research:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>focus on normative desired outcomes</li>
    <li>focus on details of specific sources</li>
</ul>
<p>In Druckman's (2005) article he provides an overview of recent conflicting research on variance in political knowledge, argues that these differences in political literacy are important, and then seeks to identify what causes them.</p>
<p>The first of two research projects that questions the value of knowing political facts argues that <span class="pullquote">citizens can compensate for a lack of political knowledge by using shortcuts</span> (Popkin's idea) to make the same decisions they would have made if they had had information. Examples of these <strong>information</strong> <strong>shortcuts</strong> are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>interest group endorsements,</li>
    <li>expert advice,</li>
    <li>ideology,</li>
    <li>party cues, and</li>
    <li>campaign expenditures.</li>
</ul>
<p>The second research project argues that citizens don't survey the facts in their minds and come to a decision. Instead, they <strong>remember an overall evaluation</strong> of a candidate in their minds and update that overall view when new facts arise without remembering the specific facts that shaped that evaluation. Thus, <span class="pullquote">the facts a person can recall don't necessarily equate to the quality of their political judgment</span> and more information is not necessarily better.</p>
<p>Druckman argues that researchers should define normative criteria for good/competent political decisions and then document how information affects these criteria. He emphasizes that future research should focus on <em>why</em> a particular type of information is important, on the <strong>desired outcomes</strong> to which it is a precursor, and on the specific sources and content of those sources. For example, it is important not just to measure <strong>media</strong> <em>type</em>, but to  measure the <em>content</em> and <em>presentation</em> features of a specific media that  facilitate learning.</p>
<h3><a name="3">Article 3</a></h3>
<p><em>by Robertson, Wania, &amp; Park</em></p>
<p><strong>Main points:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>online voter behavior differs from traditional source use</li>
    <li>decision-making is central task</li>
    <li>4 strategies for decision-making in light of voter cognitive limitations</li>
    <li>observed voter preferences and behaviors</li>
</ul>
<p>Robertson, Wania, &amp; Park (2007) report on an observational think-aloud study of people using the internet in a mock-voting situation and use the results to offer ideas for the design of a voter portal.</p>
<p>The authors contrast previous models with online political information seeking, noting that online voters:</p>
<ul>
    <li>regularly encounter persuasive content which they must <strong>interpret</strong> alongside the factual;</li>
    <li>are focused on their need to <strong>make a decision</strong>;</li>
    <li>must actively seek, filter, and remember <strong>on their own</strong>, rather than use preselected information given them by researchers; and</li>
    <li>are using a largely unstudied political information medium - the <strong>internet</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Robertson et. al. give a very helpful  overview of Lau and Redlawsk's framework which highlights <span class="pullquote">voters' <strong>cognitive limitations</strong></span>.</p>
<p>Given voters' conflicting desires to make a decision that is both good and easy, Lau and Redlawsk identify <strong><em>four decision-making strategies</em></strong> for dealing with this conflict.</p>
<ol>
    <li>In the <strong>classical rational  choice</strong> strategy, people find and process all available information in order to compare and assign values to all attributes and make all relevant trade-offs.&nbsp; The other three strategies rely on an incomplete search in order to avoid value conflicts and trade-offs.</li>
    <li><strong>Confirmatory decision making</strong> strategists, for instance, try to evaluate new learning and make it consistent  with what they already know.</li>
    <li><strong>Fast and frugal decision making</strong>, on the other hand, is not particularly concerned with consequences, but considers the many alternatives using simple heuristics.</li>
    <li>Finally, <strong>intuitive decision-making</strong> involves trading off effort with time. Interestingly, Lau and Redlawsk found that these last two strategies were often more effective than the rational choice strategy.</li>
</ol>
<p>A number of <strong>voter behaviors and preferences</strong> were noted in this study, including that the participants:</p>
<ul>
    <li>didn't use search, preferring to browse thoroughly and opportunistically, but were uninterested in comprehensive knowledge;</li>
    <li>were focused on making the voting decision throughout the search process;</li>
    <li>preferred comparative, third-party charts of candidate information;</li>
    <li>focused on three areas of candidate evaluation - prior experience, personal and occupational information, and issues/positions;</li>
    <li>used party as a cue;</li>
    <li>spent a lot of time on candidate web sites, but found them unhelpful;</li>
    <li>desired more information about the office itself; and</li>
    <li>exhibited various levels of trust in the information and sources they encountered.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="4">Article 4</a></h3>
<p><em>by U.S. Election Assistance Commission</em></p>
<p><strong>Main points:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>6 types of voters</li>
    <li>5 common voter concerns</li>
    <li>over 70 guidelines for state voter information websites</li>
</ul>
<p>The U.S. Election Assistance Commission (2008) conducted a thorough study of 71 active voter information web sites in which they catalogued common functions, and presented them to a panel of experts for discussion and review.</p>
<p>The report identifies <span class="pullquote">six <strong>types of voters</strong>, each with their own specific concerns</span>:</p>
<ol>
    <li>first-time voters;</li>
    <li>infrequent voters;</li>
    <li>consistent voters;</li>
    <li>voters with special circumstances;</li>
    <li>absentee voters; and</li>
    <li>uniformed/overseas voters.</li>
</ol>
<p>The same report also lists the following <strong><span class="pullquote">common voter concerns</span></strong>:</p>
<ol>
    <li>When,  where and how do I register to vote?</li>
    <li>Who  will be on my ballot?</li>
    <li>How  do I decide who to vote for?</li>
    <li>When,  where, and how will I be voting?</li>
    <li>Who  won the election?</li>
</ol>
<p>As the answers to all of the questions except the third are relatively short and factual, I've written an in-depth post on the third concern: <a href="how-to-research-political-candidates.html">How to research political candidates</a>. I've also reiterated the Election Commission's Voter <a href="voter-checklist-things-to-do-before-election-day.html">Checklist of things to do before election day</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of this study was to provide guidelines that will assist election administrators in developing <span class="pullquote">voter information web sites that best serve voters and encourage informed participation</span>.
