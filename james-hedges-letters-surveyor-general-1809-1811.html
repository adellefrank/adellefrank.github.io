<h2>Transcripts of Letters</h2>

<h3>26 December 1809</h3>

<p>Dier Sir<br />
Enclosed I send you a plan of the Town of Mansfield and have distinguished the lots that are sold fronting on the Diamond [<a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ohrichla/Misc-MfdStreetNames.htm">Street?</a>] by placing in them the letter A.</p>

<p>There appears to be but little differance as to the situation of the ground at the front of the lots on the Diamond, though I will just mention to you which would be my choice out of the unsold lots which fronts on the Diamond, that is, lot number one hundred and one, as marked in said plan. What lots you are desirious of purchasing you can let me know and I will endeavour to have you accomidated on reasonable terms. The price of the unsold lots on the Diamond is ninety five dollars and the rest in proportion to their situations.</p>

<p>I am, Sir, your most ob. huml. servt., James Hedges</p>

<p>Jared Mansfield, Esq.</p>

<h3>27 March 1810</h3>

<p>Dear Sir<br />
I understand by the Presidents proclamation the treaty that was concluded at Fort Wayne on the 30th of September last is confirmed. When you commence to make your arangements to have the tract of land surveyed that was ceded to the U. States at that treaty you will much oblige me by giving me a portion of it to survey, and also to inform me as early as possable whither you will have that tract of Land surveyed this summer or not and let me know if you can favour me with a district to survey.</p>

<p>I am your obd. servt., James Hedges</p>

<p>Jared Mansfield, Surv. Genl.</p>

<h3>6 May 1810</h3>

<p>Dear Sir<br />
Some time since I put a line in the post office at this place directed to you, the subject of which was requesting you to inform me what time the tract of Land that leis on the Wabash river, which was purchased from the Indians in the month of September last, will be prepared for surveying, and I not knowing whether that line has reached you or not I now forward you this: If you will be so good as to let me hear from you on that subject &amp; let me know if you can favour me with a district to survey you will much oblige your friend [&amp; c ?]</p>

<p>James Hedges</p>

<p>Jared Mansfield, Esq.</p>

<h3>27 April 1811</h3>

<p>Dear Sir<br />
I have taken the liberty of sending you a line on the subject of the removal of the land office from Canton Ohio. It appears that Congress at their late session passed a resolution for the removal of the land office from Canton, and authorized the president of the United States to select the place at which the land office now at Canton will be established within the Canton district. I have been taken a view of the map of that district from which it appears that the Town of Mansfield in the County of Richland is situated as near if not the nearest the center of the district than any other Town within the district, and I think it would be a suitable place as it respects situation for the Land office to be established at, for in case the United States had the title from the Indians of the tract of country lying on the west of that district it would likely be attached to it, which would altogether place Mansfield in the proper place for the office to be kept at. If you would take [new page] a view of the map, considering the boundaries of the Canton district as they now are, or take into view the tract of country on the west of it; and if not inconsistant with your opinion recommend to the department that has the selecting of the place for the land office; The county seat of Richland County to be the most suatible place for that purpose, it will be esteemed a favour confered on<br />
Sir, your most obt. servt., James Hedges</p>

<p>Jared Mansfield, Esq.</p>

<p>P.S. The number of the L &amp; R is mentioned on the plat of the Town of Mansfield which I sent you. There are other Towns laid out within the district above mentioned which are situated near the center of T 15 R13 -</p>

<p>Please to inform me what prospect there is this season for your affording me with surveying - If you should write shortly [illegible] to direct to Mansfield Richland County. This, as I am just going to start there &amp; will not return for ten weeks<br />
Jas. Hedges</p>
